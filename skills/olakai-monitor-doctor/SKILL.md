# Self-Heal Local Coding Agent Monitoring

This skill diagnoses and repairs **already-installed** hooks-based monitoring for a local coding tool (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor). Use it when monitoring seems broken: no events, missing KPIs, a deleted/404 agent, or a clobbered config.

> **First-time setup?** Use `olakai-monitor-local-coding-agent` instead — it covers `init`, what each tool captures, and KPI configuration. This skill is the **repair** half.

> **CLI requirement:** `monitor list`, `monitor doctor`, `monitor repair`, and `agents mine` require **olakai-cli ≥ 0.7.0**. Older CLIs only have `init` / `status` / `disable`. Upgrade: `npm install -g olakai-cli@latest`.

## The three commands, in order

If your monitoring seems broken, drive these in order. **Always start with `monitor list`, then `monitor doctor`, then escalate to `repair`.**

```bash
# 1. SEE — machine-wide picture: what's installed, where, and which entries are drifting.
olakai monitor list

# 2. DIAGNOSE — ordered health-check chain for the current workspace + tool.
olakai monitor doctor --tool claude-code         # or codex / cursor
olakai monitor doctor --all                       # every workspace on this machine

# 3. FIX — idempotent, best-effort auto-repair of what doctor flagged.
olakai monitor doctor --tool claude-code --fix

# 4. ESCALATE — forceful re-init that preserves agent linkage (heals a clobbered config).
olakai monitor repair --tool claude-code
```

## Two lenses: machine vs account

Two distinct questions, two distinct commands. Keep them straight.

| Question | Lens | Command | Source of truth |
|----------|------|---------|-----------------|
| "What is monitored on **THIS machine**, and where?" | **Machine** | `olakai monitor list` | Local registry at `~/.olakai/registry.json` |
| "What coding agents exist across my **whole account**?" | **Account** | `olakai agents mine` | Olakai backend (cross-machine) |

**The backend has no scope model** — agents are account-scoped only, with no per-repo / per-workspace / per-host fields. So "where am I monitoring?" is a purely **machine-local** fact that nobody persists server-side; the CLI records it in `~/.olakai/registry.json`, which `monitor list` reads. `monitor doctor` bridges the two lenses — it flags drift between the registry, the backend, and what's actually on disk.

```bash
olakai monitor list                              # MACHINE: every monitored workspace, grouped by tool
olakai monitor list --json
olakai agents mine                               # ACCOUNT: your coding agents across the whole account
olakai agents mine --source claude-code          # filter to one tool
olakai agents mine --source codex --json
```

## What each doctor check means

`monitor doctor` runs an **ordered chain** — each step gates the next, so the first failure is usually the real problem:

| # | Check | PASS means | A FAIL points to |
|---|-------|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | `registry-entry` | This workspace is recorded in `~/.olakai/registry.json` | Never inited here, or registry wiped → `--fix` adopts the on-disk config into the registry |
| 2 | `config-valid` | `.olakai/monitor-<tool>.json` exists and parses (key, agentId, endpoint) | Missing/corrupt config → `monitor repair` re-writes it |
| 3 | `hooks-installed` | The tool's settings file has the Olakai hook entries | Hooks removed or a settings edit clobbered them → `--fix` re-merges them |
| 4 | `api-key-valid` | The stored key authenticates (`GET /api/monitoring/prompt/me`) | Key revoked/rotated → `--fix` rotates a fresh key on the *same* agent and rewrites the config (cross-wired-key detection is a `monitor init` feature, not `doctor`) |
| 5 | `agent-exists` | The linked agent still exists on the backend | Agent deleted (404) → recreation is **gated** behind `--recreate-missing` or `repair` (so a transient 404 can't spawn a duplicate) |
| 6 | `events-flowing` | Recent events exist for this agent (metadata probe) | Hooks installed but never fired → run a turn, then re-check; if still empty see the unattributed-activity caveat below |

`--fix` is **idempotent and best-effort**: it adopts the registry entry, re-merges missing hooks, and re-links a rejected key. It will **not** recreate a missing agent unless you add `--recreate-missing` — a deliberate guard against a flaky/transient 404 spawning a duplicate agent.

> **Admin bulk-provisioned machines (olakai-cli ≥ 0.13.0):** bundles pushed by an admin via `olakai admin monitor bulk-provision` (or the Coding IQ → Settings → Bulk Provisioning UI) write the hooks and `.olakai/monitor-claude-code.json` directly, so the workspace is **not in the local registry** until the developer runs any `olakai monitor` command once — the registry reconcile then backfills it. Hooks fire and events flow regardless. A `registry-entry` FAIL (or the workspace missing from `monitor list`) on such a machine is expected, not broken — running `olakai monitor doctor --tool claude-code --fix` adopts it.

## Decision tree

```
Want the machine-wide picture ("what's monitored here")?
└── olakai monitor list   (account-wide instead? → olakai agents mine)

No events appearing?
└── olakai monitor doctor --tool <tool>      ← always start here
    ├── registry-entry FAIL  → olakai monitor doctor --tool <tool> --fix   (adopts config into registry)
    ├── hooks-installed FAIL → olakai monitor doctor --tool <tool> --fix   (re-merges hooks)
    ├── api-key-valid FAIL   → olakai monitor doctor --tool <tool> --fix   (re-links a fresh key)
    ├── agent-exists FAIL (404)
    │   ├── olakai monitor repair --tool <tool>                  (recommended — preserves linkage)
    │   └── olakai monitor doctor --tool <tool> --fix --recreate-missing
    └── events-flowing FAIL  → run one turn, re-check; Codex/Cursor in an un-inited repo
                               → silent-exit (see unattributed-activity caveat)

Config clobbered / settings file edited by hand / legacy layout?
└── olakai monitor repair --tool <tool>
    (always re-merges hooks, migrates legacy config, re-links key only if invalid,
     recreates the agent only on a TRUE 404 — never duplicates a healthy agent)
```

## `doctor --fix` vs `repair` — when to use which

| | `monitor doctor --fix` | `monitor repair --tool <t>` |
|---|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Intent | Surgical: fix only what a check flagged | Forceful re-init that **preserves** agent linkage |
| Hooks | Re-merges only if `hooks-installed` failed | **Always** re-merges (heals a clobbered settings file) |
| Legacy config | — | Migrates legacy config layout |
| API key | Re-links only if invalid | Re-links only if invalid |
| Missing agent | Recreates only with `--recreate-missing` | Recreates only on a **true 404** |
| Use when | Doctor told you exactly what's wrong | "Just make it work again" / settings got mangled |

## Scope honesty (why some sessions aren't tracked)

Where the hooks live differs by tool, and that drives what gets attributed:

| Tool | Hook scope | Where hooks are written |
|------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Claude Code | **Workspace** | `.claude/settings.json` (this workspace only) |
| Codex CLI | **Global** | `~/.codex/config.toml` (all workspaces) |
| Cursor | **Global** | `~/.cursor/hooks.json` (all workspaces) |

For all three, the per-workspace `.olakai/monitor-<tool>.json` holds the agent linkage (key + agent ID + endpoint).

> ⚠️ **Unattributed-activity caveat (Codex / Cursor).** Because Codex and Cursor hooks are **global**, they fire in *every* workspace — including ones you never ran `init` in. When the hook fires in a workspace with **no** `.olakai/monitor-<tool>.json`, it **silently exits** and that session is **NOT attributed to any agent** (no event). This is expected: a global hook with no local linkage has nowhere to report. If you expect Codex/Cursor activity from a repo and see none, the most common cause is you never ran `olakai monitor init --tool <tool>` *in that repo*. Run `olakai monitor list` to see which workspaces are linked, and `olakai monitor doctor --tool <tool>` for an in-context explanation.
>
> Claude Code does **not** have this caveat — its hooks are workspace-scoped, so they only fire where you installed them.

## Common scenarios

### "No events from my coding tool"

```bash
olakai monitor doctor --tool <tool>     # read the first failing check
olakai monitor doctor --tool <tool> --fix   # auto-repair registry/hooks/key
```

If `events-flowing` is the only failure: run one real turn and re-check. For Codex/Cursor, confirm you ran `init` **in this repo** (global-hook silent-exit otherwise).

### "My monitored agent disappeared / doctor says 404"

```bash
olakai monitor repair --tool <tool>                          # recommended — recreates only on a true 404
# or explicitly:
olakai monitor doctor --tool <tool> --fix --recreate-missing
```

### "Hooks stopped firing after a tool update (esp. Cursor)"

```bash
olakai monitor repair --tool cursor     # re-merges hook entries, preserves the agent
cursor --version                        # confirm >= 1.7
```

### "I edited my settings file by hand and broke it"

```bash
olakai monitor repair --tool <tool>     # always re-merges hooks + migrates legacy config
```

## Validate the fix (Golden Rule)

After repairing, confirm with a real event:

```bash
# 1. Run one turn in the coding tool
# 2. Fetch the latest event
olakai activity list --agent-id AGENT_ID --limit 1 --json
# 3. Inspect it
olakai activity get EVENT_ID --json | jq '{source, customData, kpiData}'
```

Confirm: event exists with a recent timestamp; `source` matches your `--tool`; `prompt`/`response`/`tokens`/`modelName` are populated; `kpiData` shows numbers (not strings or nulls). Find `AGENT_ID` via `olakai monitor status --tool <tool>` or `olakai monitor list`.

## Debug mode

When doctor passes but events still seem off, watch the dispatcher directly:

```bash
export OLAKAI_MONITOR_DEBUG=1           # then run a turn
# Inspect /tmp/olakai-monitor-debug-<pid>.log for:
#   dispatcher/posting    — payload about to be posted
#   dispatcher/posted     — HTTP status + 500-byte response preview
#   dispatcher/post-error — error details if the POST failed
#   transcript-read-failed / transcript-parsed — transcript parsing signals
```

## Quick Reference

```bash
# See (two lenses)
olakai monitor list [--json]                                 # MACHINE: what's monitored here + drift
olakai agents mine [--source claude-code|codex|cursor] [--json]   # ACCOUNT: agents across the account

# Diagnose + repair
olakai monitor doctor --tool <tool> [--fix] [--recreate-missing]
olakai monitor doctor --all [--fix]                          # every workspace on this machine
olakai monitor repair --tool <tool>                          # forceful re-init, preserves agent

# Agent lifecycle (account-wide; requires current backend)
olakai agents archive AGENT_ID [--unarchive]
olakai agents rename AGENT_ID "New Name"
olakai agents delete AGENT_ID

# Debug
export OLAKAI_MONITOR_DEBUG=1
```
